Hello there! My name is Gal Kalder. ðŸ‘‹ðŸ¤“

About me

I'm a Full Stack Web Developer from Israel and I'm practicing and passionate about all things JavaScript.

From 2016 to 2020, I was self-employed and engaged in online advertising.
I helped to create landing pages and find clients for Israeli and International companies. I have worked with AdCombo, WeSell, ClickOn companies and with private clients. In 2020, I decided to switch to a web developer and studied Full Stack Developer at John Bryce College.

I work hard, I care about writing clean code and genuinely love to learn. I'm currently looking for the right opportunity to work in an environment that will help me progress into a Full Stack Web Developer role.

You can find me at LinkedIn or write me an email drapkinvitaliy@gmail.com
